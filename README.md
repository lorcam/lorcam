- 👋 Hi, I’m @lorcam
- 👀 I’m interested in lot of things but, in this case, programming!! I'd like to become a FUll-Stack Engineer and I like Java, and Javascript frameworks, client and server side and even latest programming choices, like Python. I like well-formed, clear and efficient programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Python, React, Node.js and PHP.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any effective and real world project that helps me to get the experience that only facing and solving real problems can give.
- 📫 How to reach me: here on GitHub, at the beginning, and then will see :)
